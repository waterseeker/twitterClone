### Instructions

The objective of this project is to create a mock twitter.

It is advised to globally install nodemon and mocha since a server will be used in this project. Nodemon will allow for the server to run and continuously update when changes occur in your files.

~~~~~~
$ npm install -g nodemon bower
~~~~~~

Then:

Create a file in the root of your project called `.bowerrc`. It should contain:
```
{
  "directory": "client/components"
}
```

THEN:

~~~~~~
$ npm install
$ bower install
~~~~~~

Note: .bowerrc file specifies the path where bower components will be installed (bootstrap and jquery dependecies).
